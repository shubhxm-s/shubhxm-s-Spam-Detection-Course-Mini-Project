Introduction
This project is an implementation of a logistic regression machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is trained on a dataset of emails, with each email labeled as either spam or not spam. The model uses various features of the email, such as the sender, subject, and body, to make its predictions.

Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the project, run the main file spam_detection.py. This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, extract the features, train the model, test the model, and make predictions on new emails.
Training and Testing
The model is trained and tested on the provided dataset. The accuracy and other metrics of the model are calculated and printed to the console.
